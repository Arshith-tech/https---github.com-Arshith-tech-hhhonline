                 Heart and Hand for the Handicapped (HHH) is a not-for-profit tax-exempt 501(c) (3) organization that raises funds to support differently able children with physical and mental challenges such as polio, cerebral palsy, autism, Down's syndrome and blindness and other vision problems in India and the US. HHH was founded in 1971 by five South Asian ladies who wanted to make a difference in the lives of differently able children in India.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The organization is run by volunteers who lend their expertise in different areas. We are an organization that serves the ideal of philanthropy and adhere to the highest standard of professional practice, treating everyone with respect and dignity.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Over the years, funds have been donated to numerous organizations in India and the United States. Organizations that receive our grants must meet or exceed our rigorous standard for qualification and align with our mission. We raise funds through annual dinners, walk-a-thons, direct mail solicitations, United Way, and corporate matching programs. We also accept donations of stocks and bonds.
